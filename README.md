Supplementary information for the global Nernst equation

## Contents
Data folder contains two original data files with charge imbalance calculated, one derived from the USGS NWIS and one derived from the GEMStat world data.
The file used in example by the model code is the combined NWIS and GEMStat datasets, filtered for O2/H2O parameters and charge imbalance error. 

Model file used for O2/H2O redox couple and can be ammended to fit other redox couples.
